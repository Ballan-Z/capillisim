# How the POC Works (Operation)

This is the physical and software walkthrough of the Milestone 3 proof of
concept: how the projector, the phone camera, and the PC connect and cooperate
to guide an interactive cap-by-cap build.

## The one-line model

**The PC is the hub. The projector is just a second monitor. The phone is just
a wireless webcam.** Nothing custom runs on the projector or the phone for the
POC.

## Physical setup

```
   ┌─────────┐   HDMI               ┌──────────┐
   │   PC    │─────────────────────▶│ projector│──▶ projects onto the table 1:1
   │  (hub)  │  (2nd monitor,                          ▲  glowing target ring
   │         │   fullscreen window)                    │
   │         │                                         │  place the cap here
   │         │   Wi-Fi (same LAN)   ┌──────────┐       │
   │         │◀─────────────────────│  phone   │   hold a cap up to it
   └─────────┘   MJPEG video        └──────────┘
```

- **PC ↔ projector: HDMI cable.** The projector is a second display. The PC
  shows the projection frame as a fullscreen window on it. The projector hangs
  above the table pointing straight down.
- **PC ↔ phone: Wi-Fi, same network.** The phone runs an off-the-shelf
  IP-webcam app that serves its camera as a stream at a URL like
  `http://192.168.1.42:8080/video`. The PC reads that URL. No app to build.
- **Phone position.** It only needs to see the cap you hold up, in a small
  "reading zone" just outside the projector beam (so projection light doesn't
  tint the cap's color). It does **not** need to see the table.

## Two coordinate frames, one calibration

The only spatial calibration the POC needs is **projector → table** (Milestone
2): four markers, aligned to a taped rectangle of known size, give the
homography so the PC can light up any cell at its true position and size.

The phone camera is **not** registered to the table for the POC. Its only job is
"what color is this cap," so it needs no spatial calibration. (Registering the
camera to the table is a later feature, only needed to auto-verify that a cap
actually landed in the right cell.)

## The loop (what the PC does, ~once or twice per second)

1. Grab a frame from the phone stream.
2. Find the cap and read its dominant color (masking metallic glare).
3. Ask the matcher for the best empty cell whose target color matches, or a
   rejection if nothing is close enough.
4. Push an updated frame to the projector: faint rings for the whole plan,
   brighter rings for caps already placed, and a bright green **glow** on the
   target cell. On a rejection, no glow; that means "set this cap aside."
5. You drop the cap onto the glowing spot and press a key to confirm.
6. Mark the cell filled, save the project file, and loop to the next cap.

## A real session, start to finish

1. Mount the projector over the table; HDMI to the laptop; set the laptop
   display to "extend"; drag the projection window onto the projector.
2. Run calibration once (project 4 markers, align to a taped rectangle / enter
   the measured size).
3. Open the IP-webcam app on the phone; type its URL into the PC tool; aim the
   phone at the reading zone.
4. Pick up any cap, hold it in the reading zone → within a second or two a green
   ring lights up on the table → place the cap there → press space → next cap.
   Caps that don't help flash no target → drop them in a "later" box.
5. Stop whenever; the project file holds the state; resume next session by
   re-calibrating and loading the project.

## Minimum kit for the POC

One laptop, one projector (HDMI), one smartphone (on the same Wi-Fi as the
laptop), and the table. That's the whole rig.

## Practical notes

- **Same LAN.** Phone and laptop must share a network. Guest/isolated Wi-Fi
  blocks the stream; a phone hotspot is a fine fallback.
- **Latency.** MJPEG adds ~100–300 ms, invisible for this use.
- **Color reads.** Read the cap outside the projector beam, or briefly blank the
  projection while reading, so projected light doesn't shift the measured color.
- **Confirmation is manual** for the POC (a keypress). Auto-verify via the
  camera comes later.

## Why PC-first, phone-only later

The PC-as-hub setup is the easiest thing to get working. In the phone-only
version (Milestone 5) the phone becomes camera + brains and casts the projection
itself, collapsing the three boxes into one, but the loop above is unchanged,
which is why the matching/geometry logic lives in the device-independent core.
